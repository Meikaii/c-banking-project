# Banking Project in C
Here's my first C project. 
> This might either seem outdated/inefficient or just simply bland and boring for someone reviewing my code. Please continue with caution.

## Description
This code contains C code and no external files are needed. This can also be quite useful to those who are looking to continue or find themselves making their first project.

## End note
The code is complete but expect a few errors which will be debugged soon (worst case scenario: never). Don't expect this to be perfect. Use it as a guide or as a reference if you are planning to make a similar project. :smiley:

or even better, just yoink this code and use it as a project. ðŸ—¿

> Project is completed and possibly discontinued(?).
