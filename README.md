# Banking Project in C programming
Here's my first C project. 
> This might either seem outdated/inefficient or just simply bland and boring for someone reviewing my code. Please continue with caution.

## Description
This code contains pure C code and no other files that are to be downloaded externally. This can also be quite useful to those who are looking to continue or find themselves making their first project.

## Completion
This isn't complete yet. A few functions are missing/not yet defined. This project either continues or goes down deep to the rabbit hole.

> Also please do not send any request for this repo. It's literally useless if you do so.
