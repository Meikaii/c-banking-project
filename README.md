# Banking Project in C programming
Here's my first C project. 
> This might either seem outdated/inefficient or just simply bland and boring for someone reviewing my code. Please continue with caution.

## Description
This code contains pure C code and no other files that are to be downloaded externally. This can also be quite useful to those who are looking to continue or find themselves making their first project.

## End note
The code is complete but expect a few errors which will be debugged soon (worst case scenario: never). Don't expect this to be perfect. Use it as a guide or as a reference if you are planning to make a similar project. :smiley:

or even better, just yoink this code and use it as a project. ðŸ—¿

> Project is completed and possibly discontinued(?).
